# Crazyhouse Chess Bot

This is a basic bot, written in C++, that plays the Crazyhouse mode of chess. The bot is connected to the XBoard interface. After getting the project locally, it can be run like this:

**Firstly, run the command:**
>make

**Then, run:**
>make xboard

After that, a XBoard window will open and you can start playing chess against the bot.
For this project to run, you must have XBoard and g++ compiler installed locally.
